# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Letâ€™s play solitaire! 

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

A program where you can play a complete game of solitaire. 

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

I will use python along with pygame to program a game of solitaire. My software will deal cards and only allow the player to move the cards in regulation of the game rules. It will have graphics that shows the cards being delt and moved on a game table. This will continue to run as many rounds as the player would like.

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

N/A

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

N/A

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

A program that will deal cards accordingly, will allow the player the only place cards in places they are allowed to, show on the screen when the player wins or loses, and restarts the game if the player wants to.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

I hope to show card graphics as well as have them delt on a table. 

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

The best outcome would include an extravagant win celebration. 

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

I will research how to use pygames, as well as how to put graphics onto the screen. I think the biggest struggle would be turning the code into a display on the screen. Looking through the hurricane tracker and pig assignment will help me the most with this project.
