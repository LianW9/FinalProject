# Preproposal

## What idea(s) do you have for your final project?

A card game of solitaire

## If you plan to collaborate with one or two classmates, what are their names?

N/A

## Do you have any questions of your own?

Do we write the code on our desktops and just upload it onto here each time
or can we code on github?
I got very confused in the lecture about hwo you pulled up the code in a different browser
and was able to go back and forth
Also is there a classroom we are supposed to join on here or the link is enough?
